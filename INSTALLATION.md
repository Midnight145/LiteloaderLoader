# Installation Instructions

LiteloaderLoader requires Liteloader to be supported as a mod, not loaded alongside it separately.

To install it instead as a forge mod,

1. Download the Liteloader installer [here](https://www.liteloader.com/download#stable_1710)
2. Run the installer
3. Choose "Extract Liteloader Jar"
4. Choose a path where you'll be able to find it (like your Downloads or Desktop folder)
5. Click OK
6. In the chosen path, you will find the file `liteloader-1.7.10.jar`
7. Copy that file into your mods folder.

You'll need to remove Liteloader if installed separately, for examples through the Versions tab in MultiMC or its derivatives.
