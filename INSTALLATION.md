# Installation Instructions

LiteloaderLoader requires Liteloader to be present **as a mod**, not as a as a separate game version.

To install it as a Forge mod:

1. **Download the Liteloader installer** from  
   https://www.liteloader.com/download#stable_1710

2. **Run the installer.**

3. Select **“Extract Liteloader Jar.”**

4. Choose a location where you can easily find the file (e.g., your **Downloads** or **Desktop**).

5. Click **OK.**

6. In the chosen directory, you will now have **`liteloader-1.7.10.jar`**.

7. **Download LiteloaderLoader** from  
   https://github.com/Midnight145/LiteloaderLoader/releases/latest

8. After downloading, you should have **`LiteloaderLoader-<version>.jar`**.

9. **Place both files** —  
   - `liteloader-1.7.10.jar`  
   - `LiteloaderLoader-<version>.jar`  
   — into your **mods** folder.

---

If Liteloader was previously installed as a Loader jar version (for example via MultiMC or any of its derivatives), you will need to **remove that version** before using the mod-based installation.
